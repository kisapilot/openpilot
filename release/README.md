## creating casync build

`create_casync_build.sh` - creates a casync openpilot build, ready to upload to `openpilot-releases`

```bash
# run on a tici, within the directory you want to create the build from.
# creates a prebuilt version of openpilot into BUILD_DIR and outputs the caibx
# of a tarball containing the full prebuilt openpilot release
BUILD_DIR=/data/openpilot_build    \
CASYNC_DIR=/data/casync            \
OPENPILOT_CHANNEL=nightly          \
release/create_casync_build.sh
```

`upload_casync_release.sh` - helper for uploading a casync build to `openpilot-releases`


## release builds

to create a release build, set `RELEASE=1` environment variable when running the build script
